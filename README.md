# FinPro React (from HTML template)

This is a small React app scaffold that converts the static HTML/CSS under `html/` into React components.

What I added
- Vite + React setup (minimal): `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `index.html`
- `src/` with components: `Header`, `Banner`, `Services`, `CaseStudies`, `Testimonials`, `Team`, `Footer`

Notes
- The original styles and media are reused from `html/assets/...`. The app references them with `/html/assets/...` so you must keep the `html` folder next to this project root (which is the case).

Run locally

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
